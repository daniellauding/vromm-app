# Profile Implementation Changes

## Overview
We've updated the profile viewing and editing experience to provide a more intuitive workflow:

1. The ProfileTab now shows the public profile view (PublicProfileScreen) by default for the logged-in user
2. An Edit button allows switching to edit mode (ProfileScreen) 
3. Fixed SQL queries to properly load creator information and profile data
4. Added proper ID handling based on the database schema

## Navigation Structure
- ProfileTab now contains a nested Stack Navigator with:
  - PublicProfile (default view showing user stats and data)
  - ProfileScreen (edit mode for updating profile information)

## Data Structure
Based on the profiles_rows.sql dump, key fields include:
- id (UUID string like '5ee16b4f-5ef9-41bd-b571-a9dc895027c1')
- license_plan_completed (boolean)
- license_plan_data (JSON object with plan details)
- role_confirmed (boolean)
- school_id (foreign key to schools table, can be null)

## Implementation Details

### TabNavigator Changes

- Added ProfileScreen as a separate screen within the stack

### PublicProfileScreen Changes
- Updated to correctly handle navigation to edit mode
