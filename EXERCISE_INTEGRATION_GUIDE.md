# Exercise Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide explains the new exercise integration system that allows users to select existing learning path exercises when creating routes, and have their progress tracked across both contexts.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Route Creation with Learning Path Exercises**
- **Multi-select Interface**: Bottom sheet with search, filtering, and multi-select
- **Learning Path Integration**: Select exercises from existing learning paths
- **Mixed Exercise Types**: Combine custom exercises with learning path exercises
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear badges showing exercise types (QUIZ, VIDEO, REPEAT, etc.)

### ðŸ“Š **Progress Tracking**
- **Cross-Platform Progress**: Completing exercises in routes counts toward learning path progress
- **Repeat Exercise Support**: Handle repeat exercises and their completion tracking
- **Progress Statistics**: Track exercises completed from routes vs. learning paths
- **Completion Status**: Visual indicators showing which exercises are completed

### ðŸ”„ **Real-time Updates**
- **Instant Sync**: Exercise completions sync immediately across the app
- **Learning Path Progress**: Completing route exercises updates learning path progress
- **Statistics Updates**: User progress statistics update automatically

## Components

### 1. **ExerciseSelector**
Located: `src/components/ExerciseSelector.tsx`

A comprehensive modal for selecting learning path exercises with:
- Search functionality
- Learning path filtering
- Include/exclude repeats toggle
- Multi-select with visual indicators
- Exercise preview with badges (QUIZ, VIDEO, REPEAT, etc.)

**Usage:**
```tsx
import { ExerciseSelector } from '../components/ExerciseSelector';

const [showSelector, setShowSelector] = useState(false);
const [exercises, setExercises] = useState<Exercise[]>([]);

<ExerciseSelector
  visible={showSelector}
  onClose={() => setShowSelector(false)}
  selectedExercises={exercises}
  onExercisesChange={setExercises}
/>
```

### 2. **RouteExerciseViewer**
Located: `src/components/RouteExerciseViewer.tsx`

Displays exercises in a route with completion tracking:
- Shows exercise details and metadata
- Completion buttons for learning path exercises
- Progress tracking visualization
- Exercise type indicators

**Usage:**
```tsx
import { RouteExerciseViewer } from '../components/RouteExerciseViewer';

<RouteExerciseViewer
  routeId={routeId}
  exercises={route.exercises}
  onExerciseComplete={(exerciseId) => {
    console.log('Exercise completed:', exerciseId);
  }}
/>
```

### 3. **ExerciseProgressService**
Located: `src/services/exerciseProgressService.ts`

Service for handling exercise completion and progress tracking:

**Key Methods:**
```tsx
import ExerciseProgressService from '../services/exerciseProgressService';

// Complete a regular exercise from a route
await ExerciseProgressService.completeExerciseFromRoute(
  exerciseId,
  routeId,
  { time_spent: 120, completion_source: 'route' }
);

// Complete a repeat exercise from a route
await ExerciseProgressService.completeRepeatExerciseFromRoute(
  exerciseId,
  originalExerciseId,
  repeatNumber,
  routeId
);

// Get completion status for route exercises
const completions = await ExerciseProgressService.getRouteExerciseCompletions(
  routeId,
  exerciseIds
);

// Get user progress statistics
const stats = await ExerciseProgressService.getUserProgressStats();
```

## Data Structure

### Extended Exercise Type
The `Exercise` type in `src/types/route.ts` has been extended to support learning path integration:

```tsx
export type Exercise = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  duration?: string;
  repetitions?: string;
  
  // Learning path exercise data
  learning_path_exercise_id?: string;
  learning_path_id?: string;
  learning_path_title?: string;
  youtube_url?: string;
  icon?: string;
  image?: string;
  embed_code?: string;
  has_quiz?: boolean;
  quiz_required?: boolean;
  isRepeat?: boolean;
  originalId?: string;
  repeatNumber?: number;
  
  // Source indicator
  source?: 'custom' | 'learning_path';
};
```

### Database Integration
The system uses existing Supabase tables:
- `learning_paths`: Learning path definitions
- `learning_path_exercises`: Exercise definitions
- `learning_path_exercise_completions`: Completion tracking
- `virtual_repeat_completions`: Repeat exercise completions
- `routes`: Route definitions with exercises

## Integration Points

### CreateRouteScreen Integration
Located: `src/screens/CreateRouteScreen.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
1. **Added ExerciseSelector**: Button to open learning path exercise selector
2. **Enhanced Exercise Display**: Shows different styling for learning path vs custom exercises
3. **Extended State Management**: Handles both exercise types in unified state
4. **Improved Save Logic**: Preserves learning path exercise metadata when saving

**Key Features:**
- Green-highlighted button showing count of selected learning path exercises
- Separated custom exercise creation from learning path selection
- Visual badges for exercise types (LEARNING PATH, REPEAT, QUIZ, VIDEO)
- Enhanced exercise cards with more metadata

### Progress Screen Integration
The system is designed to work seamlessly with the existing `ProgressScreen.tsx`:
- Exercise completions from routes appear in learning path progress
- Repeat exercise completions are tracked separately
- No changes needed to existing progress tracking logic

## Usage Examples

### 1. Creating a Route with Learning Path Exercises
```tsx
// User flow:
// 1. Navigate to Create Route â†’ Exercises tab
// 2. Click "Select from Learning Paths" button
// 3. Search/filter exercises in the modal
// 4. Select desired exercises (multi-select)
// 5. Click "Done" to add them to the route
// 6. Optionally add custom exercises as well
// 7. Save the route
```

### 2. Completing Exercises in a Route
```tsx
// User flow:
// 1. Open a route that has learning path exercises
// 2. View exercises using RouteExerciseViewer
// 3. Click "Complete" button on learning path exercises
// 4. Exercise completion is tracked in both route and learning path contexts
// 5. Progress updates appear in ProgressScreen
```

### 3. Tracking Progress Statistics
```tsx
const stats = await ExerciseProgressService.getUserProgressStats();
console.log(`Total exercises completed: ${stats.totalExercisesCompleted}`);
console.log(`Completed from routes: ${stats.exercisesCompletedFromRoutes}`);
console.log(`Learning paths progressed: ${stats.uniqueLearningPathsProgressed}`);
```

## Benefits

- **Export/Import**: Share exercise collections between users

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Unknown User" in ExerciseSelector**: Ensure proper profile data is loaded
2. **Completion Not Tracking**: Check user authentication and exercise IDs
3. **Missing Exercises**: Verify learning path is active and exercises exist
4. **Performance Issues**: Consider pagination for large exercise collections

### Database Requirements
- Ensure all required tables exist in Supabase
- Verify foreign key relationships are properly set up
- Check RLS (Row Level Security) policies for exercise access

### Error Handling
The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Network failures are gracefully handled
- Invalid data is filtered out
- User feedback is provided for all operations
- Fallback displays for missing data

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Exercises are loaded only when the selector is opened
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized Supabase queries with proper indexing
- **State Management**: Minimal re-renders with efficient state updates
- **Caching**: Completion status is cached to reduce API calls

### Accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper labels and descriptions
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility in modals
- **High Contrast**: Visual indicators work in high contrast mode
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile

### Security
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own progress data
- **RLS Policies**: Proper row-level security in Supabase
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Masking**: Sensitive error details are not exposed to users

This integration provides a seamless bridge between route creation and learning path exercises, enhancing the user experience while maintaining code quality and performance.
