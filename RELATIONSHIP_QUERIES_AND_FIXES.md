# 🔍 **Relationship System - SQL Queries & Recent Fixes**

## 📊 **SQL Queries for Relationship Analysis**

### **1. Simple Relationship Check**
```sql
-- Basic relationship overview with user names and IDs
SELECT 
  ssr.created_at,
  student.full_name as student,
  supervisor.full_name as supervisor,
  student.id as student_id,
  supervisor.id as supervisor_id
FROM student_supervisor_relationships ssr
JOIN profiles student ON ssr.student_id = student.id  
JOIN profiles supervisor ON ssr.supervisor_id = supervisor.id
ORDER BY ssr.created_at DESC;
```

### **2. Detailed Relationship Analysis**
```sql
-- Comprehensive relationship data with reviews and ratings
SELECT 
  ssr.created_at as relationship_started,
  student.full_name as student_name,
  student.email as student_email,
  supervisor.full_name as supervisor_name, 
  supervisor.email as supervisor_email,
  student.id as student_id,
  supervisor.id as supervisor_id,
  
  -- Review data
  COUNT(DISTINCT rr_student.id) as student_reviews_count,
  AVG(CASE WHEN rr_student.review_type = 'student_reviews_supervisor' THEN rr_student.rating END) as student_rating_of_supervisor,
  COUNT(DISTINCT rr_supervisor.id) as supervisor_reviews_count,
  AVG(CASE WHEN rr_supervisor.review_type = 'supervisor_reviews_student' THEN rr_supervisor.rating END) as supervisor_rating_of_student,
  
  -- Review status
  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT rr_student.id) > 0 AND COUNT(DISTINCT rr_supervisor.id) > 0 THEN 'Both Reviewed'
    WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT rr_student.id) > 0 THEN 'Student Reviewed Only'
    WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT rr_supervisor.id) > 0 THEN 'Supervisor Reviewed Only'
    ELSE 'No Reviews'
  END as review_status,
  
  -- Relationship duration
  EXTRACT(DAYS FROM (NOW() - ssr.created_at)) as relationship_duration_days

FROM student_supervisor_relationships ssr
JOIN profiles student ON ssr.student_id = student.id  
JOIN profiles supervisor ON ssr.supervisor_id = supervisor.id
LEFT JOIN relationship_reviews rr_student ON (
  rr_student.student_id = ssr.student_id 
  AND rr_student.supervisor_id = ssr.supervisor_id 
  AND rr_student.review_type = 'student_reviews_supervisor'
)
LEFT JOIN relationship_reviews rr_supervisor ON (
  rr_supervisor.student_id = ssr.student_id 
  AND rr_supervisor.supervisor_id = ssr.supervisor_id 
  AND rr_supervisor.review_type = 'supervisor_reviews_student'
)
GROUP BY ssr.created_at, student.full_name, student.email, supervisor.full_name, supervisor.email, student.id, supervisor.id
ORDER BY ssr.created_at DESC;
```

### **3. Pending Invitations Overview**
```sql
-- Current pending invitations with metadata
SELECT 
  pi.id,
  pi.email,
  pi.role,
  pi.status,
  pi.created_at,
  inviter.full_name as inviter_name,
  inviter.email as inviter_email,
  pi.metadata->>'relationshipType' as relationship_type,
  pi.metadata->>'customMessage' as custom_message,
  pi.metadata->>'targetUserName' as target_name
FROM pending_invitations pi
JOIN profiles inviter ON pi.invited_by = inviter.id
WHERE pi.status IN ('pending', 'accepted')
ORDER BY pi.created_at DESC;
```

### **4. Notification Analysis**
```sql
-- Relationship-related notifications
SELECT 
  n.id,
  n.created_at,
  n.type,
  n.title,
  n.message,
  n.is_read,
  receiver.full_name as receiver_name,
  actor.full_name as actor_name,
  n.metadata->>'notification_subtype' as subtype,
  n.metadata->>'relationship_type' as relationship_type
FROM notifications n
JOIN profiles receiver ON n.user_id = receiver.id
LEFT JOIN profiles actor ON n.actor_id = actor.id
WHERE n.type IN ('supervisor_invitation', 'student_invitation')
   OR (n.type = 'new_message' AND n.metadata->>'notification_subtype' IN ('relationship_review', 'relationship_removed', 'invitation_accepted'))
ORDER BY n.created_at DESC;
```

### **5. Complete Reset Query**
```sql
-- NUCLEAR RESET - Use with caution!
DELETE FROM relationship_reviews;
DELETE FROM student_supervisor_relationships;
DELETE FROM pending_invitations;
DELETE FROM notifications 
WHERE type IN ('supervisor_invitation', 'student_invitation')
   OR (type = 'new_message' AND metadata->>'notification_subtype' IN ('relationship_review', 'relationship_removed', 'invitation_accepted'));

-- Verification
SELECT 'Active Relationships' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM student_supervisor_relationships
UNION ALL SELECT 'Relationship Reviews' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM relationship_reviews
UNION ALL SELECT 'Pending Invitations' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM pending_invitations;
```

## 🔧 **Recent Fixes Applied**

### **Fix 1: Duplicate Key Error Handling**
**Problem**: When accepting invitations, if a relationship already existed, the system threw a `23505` duplicate key error and the modal didn't close properly.

**Solution**: Updated `acceptInvitationById` in `invitationService.ts`:
```typescript
// Handle duplicate key error gracefully (relationship already exists)
if (relError && relError.code === '23505') {
  console.log('🎯 acceptInvitationById: Relationship already exists - this is OK');
} else if (relError) {
  console.error('Error creating supervisor relationship:', relError);
  // Don't fail the entire operation for relationship creation errors
  // The invitation acceptance is still valid
}
```

### **Fix 2: Removed Duplicate Invitation Section**
**Problem**: The "Manage" tab in `RelationshipManagementModal.tsx` had a duplicate "Incoming invitations" section that was out of sync.

**Solution**: Removed the duplicate section since incoming invitations are properly handled in the "Pending" tab with full Accept/Reject functionality.

### **Fix 3: Enhanced Student Removal Flow**
**Problem**: Student removal used a simple text prompt instead of the review system.

**Solution**: Updated student removal to use `RelationshipReviewModal`:
```typescript
onPress={() => {
  // Find the student details for removal review
  const studentToRemove = supervisedStudents.find(s => s.id === student.id);
  if (!studentToRemove) return;
  
  setRemovalTarget({
    id: student.id,
    name: studentToRemove.full_name,
    email: studentToRemove.email,
    role: 'student',
  });
  setShowRemovalReviewModal(true);
}}
```

### **Fix 4: Fixed TypeScript Errors**
**Problem**: Several TypeScript type errors in `RelationshipManagementModal.tsx`.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper typing for `filteredInvitations` array
- Added `metadata?: any` to pending invitations type
- Fixed various formatting and unused variable warnings

### **Fix 5: Enhanced Web Handover Documentation**
**Problem**: The `WEB_RELATIONSHIP_SYSTEM_HANDOVER.md` referenced mobile files that wouldn't be available in the target web project.

**Solution**: 
- Included complete code examples for all components
- Added full service function implementations
- Included database schema definitions
- Provided complete relationship button logic with state management
- Added comprehensive testing scenarios
