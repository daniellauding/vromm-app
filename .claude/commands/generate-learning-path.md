- Description in both English and Swedish (50-150 words, focus on learning objectives and safety)
- Repeat count (based on skill complexity)
- Completed: false

## Format to Follow

```markdown
## Exercises

### Exercise 1

**Title (EN):** [Exercise title in English]
**Title (SV):** [Exercise title in Swedish]
**Description (EN):** [Detailed description 50-150 words about what student will learn, practice techniques, and safety aspects]
**Description (SV):** [Same in Swedish]
**Completed:** false
**Repeat Count:** [2-30 based on complexity]

### Exercise 2

```

## Repeat Count Guidelines

- **Basic skills** (seat adjustment, checks): 2-3 repeats
- **Motor skills** (clutch control, steering): 5-30 repeats
- **Complex maneuvers** (parking, hill starts): 3-8 repeats
- **Safety procedures**: 2-4 repeats
- **High-frequency practice** (finding biting point): 10-30 repeats

## Content Quality Guidelines

### Descriptions
- 50-150 words per description
- Focus on learning objectives
- Include safety aspects

## Example Reference

Here's a good example of exercise quality:

```markdown
### Exercise 2

**Title (EN):** Finding the Biting Point
**Title (SV):** Känna dragläge
**Description (EN):** Practice holding and releasing clutch to find the biting point. This critical skill helps you control the car at very low speeds and prevents stalling. Feel for the moment when the engine note changes and the car wants to move forward. Hold this position steady with your foot.
**Description (SV):** Öva att hålla och släppa kopplingen för att hitta dragläget. Denna viktiga färdighet hjälper dig att kontrollera bilen i mycket låga hastigheter och förhindrar motorstopp. Känn efter det ögonblick då motorljudet förändras och bilen vill röra sig framåt. Håll denna position stadigt med foten.
**Completed:** false
**Repeat Count:** 30
```
