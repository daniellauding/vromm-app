## üóÑÔ∏è Database Verification Queries

### **Check User Account Status**
```sql
SELECT id, full_name, email, account_status 
FROM profiles 
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

### **Check Routes Deletion**
```sql
-- Should return 0 if private routes deleted
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM routes 
WHERE creator_id = 'user-uuid' AND is_public = false;

-- Should return 0 if public routes deleted
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM routes 
WHERE creator_id = 'user-uuid' AND is_public = true;
```

### **Check Content Deletion**
```sql
-- Check events
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE creator_id = 'user-uuid';

-- Check exercises
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM learning_path_exercise_completions WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid';

-- Check reviews
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reviews WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid';

-- Check comments
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid';
```

### **Check Transfer to System Account**
```sql
-- Should show public routes now owned by system
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM routes 
WHERE creator_id = '22f2bccb-efb5-4f67-85fd-8078a25acebc';
```
