# Fix Invitation System Issues

## Problem Analysis

The invitation system has several critical issues:

1. **Deleted User Access**: Users with `account_status = 'deleted'` can still login and access the app
2. **Missing Data Column**: The notifications table is missing the `data` JSONB column
3. **Duplicate User Creation**: System tries to create new users when inviting existing users
4. **Invitation Flow Confusion**: Need to distinguish between inviting existing users vs creating new users

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed NotificationsScreen Type Safety
- Added helper function `getNotificationData()` to safely access notification data
- Updated all notification navigation to use proper types
- Fixed date formatting with null checks

### 2. Database Fixes (Run fix_critical_issues.sql)
- Added missing `data` column to notifications table
- Fixed RLS policies to block deleted users
- Enhanced user creation function with better error handling
- Added proper notification types enum

### 3. Invitation System Logic Fix

The core issue is that the system should:

**For Existing Users:**
- Search and select from existing users
- Send in-app notification + push notification
- Create relationship directly (no user creation)

**For New Users:**
- Enter email addresses
- Create new user accounts with passwords
- Send email with credentials + app invitation
- Create relationship after user confirms account

## Implementation Status

✅ Fixed NotificationsScreen type safety issues
✅ Created SQL fixes for database structure
✅ Added debugging commands
⏳ Need to run SQL fixes in Supabase
⏳ Need to test invitation flows

## Next Steps

1. Run the SQL fixes in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Test deleted user blocking
3. Test invitation notifications in NotificationBell
4. Fix invitation system to properly distinguish user types
