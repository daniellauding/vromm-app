# Invitation System Debug Instructions

## 🚨 **SQL Script Errors Fixed**

The previous SQL scripts had syntax errors. I've created a **fixed version** that will work properly.

## 📋 **Use This Fixed Script**

**Run this SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:**

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of SIMPLE_INVITATION_DEBUG.sql
```

## 🔧 **What the Fixed Script Does**

1. **Table Existence Check** - Shows which invitation tables exist
2. **Pending Invitations Stats** - Counts by status (pending, accepted, declined)
3. **Relationships Stats** - Shows active relationships
4. **Notifications Stats** - Shows notification counts by type
5. **Collection Invitations** - Checks if collection sharing is available
6. **Recent Activity** - Shows activity in last 24 hours
7. **Potential Issues** - Identifies data problems
8. **Conversion Rate** - Shows invitation success rate
9. **Invitation Types** - Breaks down by relationship type
10. **Notification Types** - Shows notification categories

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### **If Everything is Working:**
- ✅ All core tables exist
- ✅ Invitations are being created
- ✅ Relationships are being formed
- ✅ Notifications are being sent
- ✅ Conversion rate is reasonable

### **If There Are Issues:**
- ❌ Missing tables (collection_invitations)
- ❌ No recent activity
- ❌ Low conversion rates
- ❌ Data inconsistencies

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

1. **Table Existence**: All required tables should exist
2. **Recent Activity**: Should see recent invitations/relationships
3. **Conversion Rate**: Should be > 0% if invitations are being accepted
4. **Issues**: Should identify any data problems

## 📊 **Next Steps Based on Results**

### **If Tables Are Missing:**
- Run the table creation scripts
- Set up proper RLS policies

### **If No Recent Activity:**
- Test invitation creation
- Check for RLS policy issues
- Verify notification delivery

### **If Low Conversion Rate:**
- Check invitation acceptance flow
- Verify relationship creation
- Test notification handling

## 🎯 **Quick Test**

After running the debug script, try:

1. **Create a test invitation** via any component
2. **Check if it appears** in pending_invitations
3. **Check if notification is created**
4. **Test acceptance flow**
5. **Verify relationship is created**

This will help identify exactly where the invitation system is working or failing.
